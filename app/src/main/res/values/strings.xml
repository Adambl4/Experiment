        Rise and shine, %s. You\'re probably wondering what happened.
        You\'re in my trap. Every day of your life you have installed apps that you don\'t need.
        You have given all permission to them without paying attention. Now the app will be the
        cause of your android device death.
        But I will give you a chance. There are ways to win this, hidden all around you.
        Remember, the cause of all this         is you, look at ourselves.
        Let the game begin.
